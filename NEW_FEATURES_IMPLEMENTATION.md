# New Features Implementation Summary

## âœ… **Three Major Features Successfully Implemented**

### **1. Personalized Monthly Usage Reset Based on Registration Date**

**Previous Behavior:**
- Usage limits reset on the 1st of every month for all users
- All users had the same reset schedule regardless of registration date

**New Behavior:**
- Each user's usage limits reset on their registration anniversary date every month
- Personalized billing cycles for each individual user
- Example: User registered on March 15th â†’ Usage resets on 15th of every month

**Technical Implementation:**
- Enhanced `UsageTracker.php` model with new methods:
  - `getUserCurrentMonth($user_id)` - Calculates personalized current billing period
  - `getUserNextResetDate($user_id)` - Determines when usage will next reset
- Updated `trackUsage()`, `getCurrentUsage()`, and `getUserUsageSummary()` methods
- Modified notification system to use personalized reset dates
- Handles edge cases for months with varying days (e.g., February, 30th/31st)

**User Benefits:**
- âœ… Fair usage distribution throughout the month
- âœ… No mass usage reset causing server load spikes
- âœ… Personalized experience based on registration date
- âœ… More balanced server resource utilization

### **2. Admin Functionality to Promote Users to Premium Membership**

**New Admin Capabilities:**
- Instant promotion of any user to Premium membership
- Instant demotion of Premium users back to Free membership
- Visual membership status in user management interface

**Technical Implementation:**
- Enhanced `users.php` admin view with:
  - New "Membership" column showing current tier (Free/Premium)
  - Crown icons for promotion buttons
  - Confirmation dialogs with user-friendly messages
  - Form submission handling for membership changes
- Added POST request handling for:
  - `promote_premium` - Upgrades user to Premium tier

### **3. Usage Tracking Only on Copy-to-Clipboard Actions**

**Previous Behavior:**
- Usage count incremented when prompts were viewed or accessed
- Automatic usage tracking on various prompt interactions

**New Behavior:**
- Usage count ONLY increments when users actually copy prompts to clipboard
- Reflects true usage patterns based on actual prompt utilization
- More accurate analytics for prompt popularity

**Technical Implementation:**
- Enhanced `copyToClipboard()` JavaScript function in `app.js`:
  - Added optional `promptId` parameter
  - Automatic API call to track usage when prompt is copied
  - Fallback tracking for older browsers
- Updated prompt view (`prompt.php`):
  - Copy button now passes prompt ID for tracking
  - Usage tracking occurs only on successful copy operations
- Leveraged existing `increment_usage` API endpoint
- Error handling for failed tracking attempts (non-blocking)

**User Experience Benefits:**
- âœ… More accurate usage statistics
- âœ… Usage reflects actual prompt utility
- âœ… Better analytics for prompt creators
- âœ… No penalty for browsing or viewing prompts
- âœ… Seamless user experience with background tracking

## ðŸ”§ **Technical Details**

### **Modified Files:**
1. **`app/models/UsageTracker.php`** - Core usage tracking logic with personalized reset dates
2. **`app/views/users.php`** - Admin user management with promotion functionality
3. **`app/views/prompt.php`** - Updated copy button to track usage
4. **`assets/js/app.js`** - Enhanced copy functionality with usage tracking

### **Key Database Changes:**
- No schema changes required - leveraged existing `usage_tracking` table
- Personalized reset dates calculated dynamically based on user registration
- Existing membership tier system used for promotions

### **Security Considerations:**
- âœ… Admin-only access for membership promotions
- âœ… Confirmation dialogs prevent accidental changes
- âœ… User cannot modify their own membership tier
- âœ… Proper error handling and logging
- âœ… Non-blocking usage tracking (failures don't affect user experience)

### **Performance Optimizations:**
- âœ… Efficient date calculations for personalized resets
- âœ… Asynchronous usage tracking doesn't block copy operations
- âœ… Cached calculations for repeated date operations
- âœ… Graceful fallbacks for edge cases
